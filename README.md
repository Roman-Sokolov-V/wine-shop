# 🐾 Adaptable - Full-Stack Animal Shelter Platform

![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)

## About The Project

Every year, millions of wonderful, loving animals wait in shelters for a second chance. Adaptable was created to bridge the gap between these pets and potential adopters. We tackle the common frustrations of the adoption journey—like visiting multiple shelters and browsing outdated websites—by creating a single, reliable, and seamless experience.

By leveraging modern technology, including an AI-powered assistant, we make finding and adopting a pet easier and more joyful than ever before.

### Key Goals
- **Connect Animals with Families**: Help homeless animals find loving and permanent homes.
- **Streamline the Adoption Process**: Simplify the adoption workflow for both shelters and adopters.
- **Increase Shelter Support**: Provide easy and accessible ways for the community to donate and volunteer.
- **Educate the Community**: Share valuable information about responsible pet ownership and animal welfare.
